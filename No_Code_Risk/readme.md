# No Code Risk: What Happens When We Leave No Code up for Grabs

[View on OWASP Global AppSec APAC schedule](https://globalappsecapac.events.whova.com/Agenda/2553625)

## Abstract

Business professionals are no longer waiting for IT to address their needs. Instead, they are increasingly building their own applications with Low-Code/No-Code platforms. Recent surveys show that most enterprise apps are now built outside of IT by business professionals who hold no previous experience in building software.

And so, enterprises are placing *developer-level power* in the hands of 100x *new* business developers.. What could go wrong?

In short, everything.

In this presentation, we will share extensive research on the security of Low-Code applications based on scanning >100K applications across hundreds of enterprise environments. We will demonstrate how most applications get identity, access and data flow wrong, cover a wide range of security issues found in real environments, and share their backstories and implications.

Next, we will share the first-ever security framework for categorization and mitigation of common Low-Code security issues. We will illustrate why the involvement of AppSec teams is desperately missing from business-led development, and share stories about organizations that got it right.

Finally, we will leave you with an open-source low-code “goat” application, so you can try it out for yourselves and help educate others and become a low-code security champion in your organization.
